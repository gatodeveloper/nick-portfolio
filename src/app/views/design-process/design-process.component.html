          <h4>Start with empathy</h4>
          <p>Dig deep. Creating a solution to a specific problem should always start with developing a genuine and personal understanding of the people being affected by that problem. Designing a purposeful solutions comes from engaging in the user’s daily lives and trying to understand their xperiences and motivations.</p>

          <h4>Research and discovery</h4>
          <p>The sooner you can begin the discovery and research phase, the better. Using the right research methods is a very valuable in producing data and insights. But like most design process, it does not have to be a linear ‘start & finish’ task. Research should continue throughout the entire life cycle of a product. This will lead to a refined product that constantly evolves with the needs of users. </p>

          <h4>Define the problem</h4>
          <p>In design, it’s critical to question what you're creating, and why. Defining the problem is a way to gain clarity and ensure you’re not only solving the right problem, but also that your team is working towards a common goal. Taking the time to clarify which problem the team is solving will make the entire design process smoother because everyone will be focused on solving the right problem. But how do you find the right problem to solve? You ask the right questions. </p>

          <h4>Brainstorm and explore </h4>
          <p>Generate ideas, all kinds of ideas. Start with the most outlandish and crazy ones. Brainstorm sessions can leverage the collective abilities and thinking of a group, by engaging with each other, listening, and building on other’s ideas. Like many other tools in the design process, brainstorming should be used frequently and throughout the product life cycle. It’s a gateway to exploration and exposes the team to creative collaboration.</p>

          <h4>Prototype, iterate, and build </h4>
          <p>Maybe it’s a desktop or mobile application, a car infotainment interface, or a bank ATM. Using rapid prototyping enables designers to validate ideas with users, stakeholders, developers and other team members early in the design process. Once a specific set of goals is achieved through prototyping and validation, designs can then be handed off to the development team. Ultimately, rapid prototyping creates team discussion through visuals instead of words, leading to a better design faster.</p>

          <h4>Test, iterate, repeat</h4>
          <p>Testing allows designers to refine products before they are built. User testing reveals psychological and behavioural insights from users that will improve not just user interfaces and products, but also business as a whole. The more designers understand their users, the stronger and more successful the product and business will become. User testing saves companies a lot of money, but more importanlty, allows designs to product a truly delight experience. </p>
