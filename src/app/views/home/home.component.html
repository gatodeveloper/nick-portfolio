              <p>Emerge is an online marketplace challenging the status quo of supplemental insurance. As a startup, they needed help pushing their desktop and mobile experiences in the right direction.</p>

              <p>I was hired to collaborate with the team and improve the UX/UI throughout the site. In the end, I redesigned multiple aspects of the site which resulted in reduced bounces rates, higher conversions, and ultimately more sales.</p>

              <p>As the cofounder of DakotaFox, we designed a physical product for rural roads in North Dakota to alert truck drivers to low hanging power lines. Accidents stemming from power line collisions were costing companies around $50,000 USD. </p>

              <p>After conducting numerous interviews, rapid prototyping and field testing, we built a solution that also stood up to the unique challenges of the extreme North Dakota weather.  </p>
